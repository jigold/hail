Pipeline
========

Pipeline is a Python module for creating and executing tasks. A task consists of a bash
command to run as well as a specification of the resources required and some metadata.
Pipeline allows you to easily build complicated pipelines with many tasks and numerous
dependencies. Tasks can either be executed locally or with the :ref:`Batch Service <batch-service>`.
