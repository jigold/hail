# Exporting Data to TSV

Hail has three export modules which write to TSVs:
 
 - [`exportsamples`](commands.html#exportsamples)
 - [`exportvariants`](commands.html#exportvariants)
 - [`exportgenotypes`](commands.html#exportgenotypes)
 
These three export modules take a condition argument (`-c`) similar to [filtering](#Filtering) expressions, with a similar namespace as well.  However, the expression is not parsed as a boolean, but rather a comma-delimited list of fields or expressions to print.  These fields will be printed in the order they appear in the expression in the header and on each line.

## Export modules

1. [`exportsamples`](commands.html#exportsamples) will print one line per sample in the VDS.  The accessible namespace includes:
   - `s` (sample)
   - `sa` (sample annotations)
   - `global` (global annotations)
   - `gs` (genotype column [aggregable](#aggregables))
2. [`exportvariants`](commands.html#exportvariants) will print one line per variant in the VDS.  The accessible namespace includes:
   - `v` (variant)
   - `va` (variant annotations)
   - `global` (global annotations)
   - `gs` (genotype row [aggregable](#aggregables))
3. [`exportgenotypes`](commands.html#exportgenotypes) will print one line per cell (genotype) in the VDS<sup>*</sup>.  The accessible namespace includes:
   - `g` (genotype)
   - `s` (sample)
   - `sa` (sample annotations)
   - `v` (variant)
   - `va` (variant annotations).
   - `global` (global annotations)
   
<sup>*</sup>The [`exportgenotypes`](commands.html#exportgenotypes) module does not print hom-ref or missing genotypes by default, in order to restrict the size of the file produced.  There are command line arguments to turn on these print modes:
 
 - `--print-ref`
 - `--print-missing`
   
## Designating output with .columns files

Hail supports reading in a file ending with ".columns" to assign column names and expressions.  This file should contain one line per desired column.  Each line should contain two fields, separated by a tab: the header name in the first, the expression in the second.  Below are two examples of acceptable columns files:

```
$ cat exportVariants.columns
VARIANT	v
PASS	va.pass
FILTERS	va.filters
MISSINGNESS	1 - va.qc.callRate
```

```
$ cat exportGenotypes.columns
SAMPLE	s
VARIANT	v
GQ	g.gq
DP	g.dp
ANNO1	va.MyAnnotations.anno1
ANNO2	va.MyAnnotations.anno2
```
 
Appropriate command line usages using these .columns files are as follows:

```
exportvariants -c 'exportVariants.columns' -o file.tsv
```

```
exportgenotypes -c 'exportGenotypes.columns' -o file2.tsv
```

## Designating output with an expression

Much like [filtering](#Filtering) modules, exporting allows flexible expressions to be written on the command line.  While the filtering modules expect an expression that evaluates to true or false, export modules expect a comma-separated list of fields to print.  These fields should take the form `IDENTIFIER = <expression>`.  Below are examples of acceptable export expressions:

```
exportvariants -c 'VARIANT = v, PASS = va.pass, FILTERS = va.filters, MISSINGNESS = 1 - va.qc.callRate' -o file.tsv
```

```
exportgenotypes -c 'SAMPLE=s,VARIANT=v,GQ=g.gq,DP=g.dp,ANNO1=va.MyAnnotations.anno1,ANNO2=va.MyAnnotations.anno2' -o file.tsv
```

Note that the above two expressions will result in identical output to the example .columns files above.

It is also possible to export without identifiers, which will result in a file with no header.  In this case, the expressions should look like the examples below:
```
exportsamples -c 's.id, sa.qc.rTiTv' -o file.tsv
```
```
exportvariants -c 'v,va.pass,va.qc.AF' -o file.tsv
```
```
exportgenotypes -c 'v,s.id,g.gq' -o file.tsv
```

**Note:** if some fields have identifiers and some do not, Hail will throw an exception.  Either each field must be identified, or each field should include only an expression.
