### Notes:

 - These modules compute a variety of statistics from the genotype data, collapsing across variants.  The output from these modes can be written to TSV files, or stored within variant annotations for later use in [filtering](intro.html#Filtering) and [export](intro.html#ExportingTSV). These can be accessed with `va.qc.<identifier>`.  The statistics, their types, and brief descriptions of how they are calculated are listed below.

 - Standard deviations are calculated with zero degrees of freedom.

 - Many values can be missing (`NA`).  Missingness is handled properly in filtering and is written as "NA" in export modules.
